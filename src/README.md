# Mabool for Thomson Computers(MO5 & TO7/70)

The source code of Mabool is written in Microsoft Basic 1.0, included in the original ROM of 8-bit computers of the time. In order to save time and comfort, the code has been written in RSCRIPT. RSCRIPT is a transpiler coded in NODEJS, which transforms .rscript scripts into final BASIC code, readable by older machines. 

Purists will probably be suspicious of this programming approach, or even disappointed, but if you look at the .rscript files, you will see that it is indeed BASIC of the time, and not a specific language for RSCRIPT.

<b>Build the BASIC code from sources</b><br>
To build the final BASIC code from the .rscript source files, execute the batch script "<b>build.bat</b>".
